As a Hispanic individual, I have seen the struggles that my community faces when it comes to financial literacy. I wanted to create a project that would help my community achieve financial stability and well-being to foster long-term prosperity. ProsperaViva is an AI-powered financial empowerment and budgeting app designed to facilitate Hispanic/Latinx populations to achieve financial stability and well-being to foster long-term prosperity.

In light of Hispanic Heritage Month, I wanted to create a project that would help the Hispanic community's biggest issueâ€”financial insecurity. Ultimately, financial insecurity has caused many problems, such as food insecurity and lack of access to education, which has created numerous problems for the Hispanic/Latinx community.

This prototype was a creation in response to this issue. I hope to continue to develop this project and make it accessible to the Hispanic/Latinx community. Additionally, this project is in alpha stage and will continue to be developed to better serve the Hispanic/Latinx community.

## How I built it

Using TS, React, and Node.js, I built the frontend and backend of the app. I used OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API to power the AI chatbot and financial advisor. I also used MongoDB to store user data and financial information. Many future features were implemented into this project; however, they were unfinished due to time constraints and the project being solo. It has built in EJS support and MongoDB support to make use of the features in the app.

## Challenges I ran into

I ran into many challenges while building this project. One of the biggest challenges was integrating the AI chatbot and financial advisor. I had never worked with OpenAI's API before, so it was challenging to figure out how to use it effectively. Additionally, I had never built a financial app before, so it was challenging to figure out how to structure the app and what features to include. I also had to learn how to incorporate the OpenAI API into the app, which was a new experience for me. I have never used OpenAI before because of the initial cost, but I was able to pay for the API using my own funds. Additionally, TS incorporation was very hard to do and remained a huge challenge, such as the TS config file and the webpack.
